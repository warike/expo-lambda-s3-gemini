# Welcome to Vantage Pro2

Your Vantage Pro2™ Weather Station console displays and records your station’s weather data, provides graph and alarm functions, and interfaces to the WeatherLink Cloud, mobile apps with an optional **WeatherLink Live™** or data logger. With a WeatherLink data logger, you can also use **WeatherLink Computer Software** to access your data on your computer.

Vantage Pro2 stations are available in two basic versions: cabled and wireless. A cabled Vantage Pro2 station transmits outside sensor data from the Integrated Sensor Suite (ISS) to the console using a straight-through four-conductor cable. A wireless Vantage Pro2 station transmits outside sensor data from the ISS to the console via a low-power radio.

Wireless consoles have an antenna that rotates 180° forward. It is important that you do not over rotate the antenna by forcing it backward beyond the up or down positions.

> **Note:** If your console is part of a cabled system, there is no antenna.

> **Note:** Wireless consoles can also collect data from optional sensors or a Davis Vantage Vue ISS, and can also retransmit data to other Vantage Pro2 or Vantage Vue consoles. You can have an unlimited number of consoles - one in each room!

The Vantage Pro2 Quick Reference Guide included with your station provides an easy to use reference for most console functions.

## Console Features

The keyboard lets you view current and historical data, set and clear alarms, change station models, enter calibration numbers, set up and view graphs, select sensors, and read the forecast. The keyboard consists of 12 command keys located next to the screen display and four navigation keys located below the command keys.

A weather variable or console command is printed on each command key. Just press a key to select the variable or function printed on that key.

Each command key also has a secondary function which is printed above the key on the console case. To select the secondary function, press and release **2ND** (on the front of the console, upper right corner) and then immediately press the key for that function.

After pressing **2ND**, the **2ND** icon displays above the barometer reading on the screen for three seconds. All secondary key functions are enabled during this time. Keys resume normal operation after the icon disappears.

The **+** and **-** navigation keys, along with **<** and **>** navigation keys are used to select command options, adjust values, and to provide additional functions when used in combination with a command key.

# Installing the Console

The Vantage Pro2 console is designed to give extremely accurate readings. As with any precision instrument, use care in its assembly and handling. Although installing the console is relatively simple, following the steps outlined in this chapter and assembling the Vantage Pro2 correctly from the start will help ensure that you enjoy all of its features with a minimum of time and effort.

## Powering the Console

### Cabled Vantage Pro2 Stations

Cabled Vantage Pro2 consoles supply power to the sensor suite through the console cable. Because of the added power consumption of the sensor suite, the cabled console requires an AC power adapter used as the main power supply. The console batteries provide backup power for up to four to six weeks.

### Wireless Vantage Pro2 Stations

Wireless Vantage Pro2 consoles do not require the use of an AC adapter. You may use the included adapter if you wish, but the three C-cell batteries should power a wireless console for up to nine months.

> **Note:** When using an AC Power adapter, be sure to use the power adapter supplied with your Vantage Pro2 Console. Your console may be damaged by connecting the wrong power adapter. The console does not recharge the batteries. Because of this, and because NiCad batteries do not power the console as long as alkaline batteries, use alkaline batteries in the console.

### Installing the AC Power Adapter

1. Remove the battery cover located on the back of the console by pressing down on the two latches at the top of the cover.
2. Find the power jack located on the bottom of the console case.
3. Insert the power adapter plug into the console power jack, then plug the other end of the adapter into an appropriate power outlet.
4. Check to make sure the console runs through a brief self-test procedure successfully. On power up, the console displays all the LCD segments and beeps twice. A message displays in the ticker banner at the bottom of the console, followed by the first screen that displays during Setup Mode. Press and hold **DONE** to skip the message and enter into Setup Mode.

Setup Mode guides you through steps required to configure the station. See “Setup Mode” on page 11 for more information.

### Installing Batteries

1. Remove the battery cover located on the back of the console by pressing down on the two latches at the top of the cover.
2. Insert three C batteries into the battery channel, negative (or flat) terminal first.
3. Replace the battery cover.

### Connecting Cabled Stations

Cabled Vantage Pro2 stations come with 100 feet (30m) of cable. This cable is used for connecting the console to the Integrated Sensor Suite. Maximum cable length from sensor suite to the console using Davis Instruments cables is 1000 feet. To connect the console to the sensor suite:

1. Firmly insert the console end of the straight-through four-conductor wire into the console receptacle marked **“ISS”** until it clicks into place. Do not force the connector into the receptacle.
2. Ensure that the sensor suite cable is not twisted through the access port.

> **Note:** The sensor suite must be assembled and connected to the console so that it is receiving power before the console connection can be tested.

Once the console and sensor suite are both powered up, cable connection should be tested and established.

Once the console is powered, it automatically enters Setup Mode. You can step through the Setup Mode options, or exit the Setup Mode to test the connection and sensor readings in Current Weather Mode. See “Setup Mode” on page 11 for Setup Mode options. See “Current Weather Mode” on page 20 for viewing and verifying current weather data coming from the cabled console.

To verify that the console is receiving data from the sensor suite through the console connection, see “Cabled Sensor Suite Assembly” in the Sensor Suite Installation Manual.

### Console Location

Place the console in a location where the keyboard is easily accessible and the display is easy to read. For more accurate readings:

* Avoid placing the console in direct sunlight. This may cause erroneous inside temperature and humidity readings and may damage the unit.
* Avoid placing the console near radiators or heating/air conditioning ducts.
* If you are mounting the console on a wall, choose an interior wall. Avoid exterior walls that tend to heat up or cool down depending on the weather.
* If you have a wireless console, be aware of possible interference from cordless phones or other devices. To prevent interference, maintain a distance of 10 feet between the Vantage Pro2 console and a cordless phone (handset and base).
* Avoid positioning a wireless console near large metallic appliances such as refrigerators, televisions, heaters, or air conditioners.
* The console antenna does not rotate in a complete circle. Avoid forcing the console antenna when rotating it.

### Table & Shelf Placement

The console kickstand can be set to three different angles allowing five different display angles.

1. Install the two round rubber feet on the bottom of the console. The rubber feet help prevent damage to furniture and surfaces.
2. Lean the kickstand out by pulling on its top edge. You’ll see the indentation for your finger at the top edge of the console.
3. Slide the catch to rest the kickstand in the appropriate angle.

Choose low angles for display on a coffee table or other low area. Choose higher angles for display on a desk or shelf.

4. Install the two rubber channel feet on the kickstand.
5. If necessary, pull up on the stand to close it. It will be a little tight, so it’s okay to push hard enough to get it to slide.

### Wall Mounting

The console mounts to the wall using two keyholes located on the back of the case.

To mount the console on a wall:

1. Use a ruler to mark two mounting hole positions on the wall 8 inches (203 mm) apart.
> **Note:** This is a representation for the mounting hole positions. This template is not true to size.
> If installing a cabled Vantage Pro2 console with sensor cable running inside the wall, mount the console over an empty switch box.


2. Use a drill and a 3/32 or 7/64'' (2.5 mm) drill bit to drill two pilot holes for the screws.
3. Using a screwdriver, drive the two #6 x 1'' pan head self-threading screws into the wall. Leave at least 1/8'' (3 mm) between the wall and the heads of the screws.
4. If the kickstand has been pulled out from the case, push it back into its upright and locked position.
5. Guide the two keyholes on the back of the console over the two screws.

**To Display Rain in Metric Units in WeatherLink**

Refer to the WeatherLink Online Help for instructions to set the rain collector to 0.2 mm and to select millimeters as the unit for rain.

### Screen 13: Rain Season

Because rainy seasons begin and end at different times in different parts of the world, you must specify the month you wish your yearly rain data to begin. January 1st is the default. The date the rain season begins affects yearly rain rate highs and lows.

1. Press the **+** and **-** keys to select the month for the start of the rainy season.
2. Press **DONE** to move to the next screen.

> **Note:** This setting determines when the yearly rain total is reset to zero. Davis Instruments recommends a January rain season setting (the default), unless you reside in the west coast of the United States, the Mediterranean coast, experience dry winters in the Southern Hemisphere. If so, change the rain season setting to July 1st. If you are performing hydrology studies in any of these climates in the Northern Hemisphere, change the rain season setting to October 1st.

### Screen 14: Serial Baud Rate

The Baud Rate screen displays only if the console detects that a WeatherLink data logger installed on the console.

The console uses a serial or USB port to communicate with a computer. If you are connecting the console directly to your computer via USB or Ethernet, leave the setting at **19200**, the highest rate for the port. If you’re using a modem, use the highest setting your modem can handle. The console must be equipped with a WeatherLink data logger to communicate with a computer or modem.

### Clear All Command

After you have completed the above setup procedures and have exited the Setup Mode, please use the Clear All command before putting your weather station into service.

The Clear All command clears all stored high and low weather data including monthly and yearly highs and lows and clears the alarm settings. The command is recommended to properly clear the console of any erroneous data before first putting the station into use.

1. Make sure wind speed is showing in the wind compass. If wind direction is showing, press **WIND** on the console until wind speed appears.
2. Press **2ND**, then press and hold **CLEAR** for at least six seconds.
3. Release **CLEAR** when you see “CLEARING NOW” displayed at the bottom of the console’s screen.
